1.  Change the ball / paddle interaction based on info in Evernote notes
2.  Move the hit detection tests into the respective classes
  e.g in the main loop:
    for each ball {
      ball.velocity = ball.checkPaddle()
      ball.velocity = ball.checkBrick()
      ball.velocity = ball.checkEdges()
      }
3.  Implement other powerups
